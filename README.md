# French-Playing-Cards

Welcome to the **French Playing Cards - Classification** repository.
This project aims to develop a mobile app designed for blind individuals or those with vision difficulties who wish to enjoy playing cards.
It features a comprehensive dataset, a classification model, and an interactive web application for classifying French playing cards. Below, you'll find detailed information on the dataset, the model, and how to use the application.

## Repository Overview

This repository includes the following main components:

- **Dataset**: French Playing Cards Dataset
- **Model**: Pre-trained model for classifying French playing cards
- **App**: Interactive web application for card classification

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be found on **Hugging Face**:

- **Dataset URL**: [French Playing Cards Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/drFarid/French-Playing-Cards)

## Model

The classification model is a pre-trained neural network designed to accurately identify the suit and rank of French playing cards.
The model is hosted on **Hugging Face** and can be accessed here:

- **Model URL**: [French Playing Cards Classification Model](https://huggingface.co/drFarid/French-Playing-Cards-Classification/tree/main)

The model is trained to recognize the following categories:
- **Suits**: Coeur (Hearts), Carreau (Diamonds), Tr√®fle (Clubs), Pique (Spades)
- **Ranks**: As (Ace), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Valet (Jack), Dame (Queen), Roi (King)

## App

An interactive web application has been created to allow users to upload images of French playing cards and get real-time classification results using the pre-trained model. The app is available on Hugging Face Spaces:

- **App URL**: [French Playing Cards Classification App](https://huggingface.co/spaces/drFarid/French-Playing-Cards-Classification)

### Usage

1. **Visit the App**: Go to the [French Playing Cards Classification App](https://huggingface.co/spaces/drFarid/French-Playing-Cards-Classification) URL.
2. **Upload an Image**: Click on the upload button to select an image of a French playing card from your device.
3. **Get Classification**: Once the image is uploaded, the app will display the predicted suit and rank of the card.
